# **Reroll**

"Reroll" is a school project. The product is designed to search statistics for your TFT games and view them according to their game type. Using standard web development tools like HTML, CSS, and JS along with libraries like Bootstrap and JQuery. From the league clients, a problem arises when players would want to see their games based on the TFT game type. For example: the current TFT match history client could not be sorted to the game modes like Normal, Ranked, Double-up (Beta), and Hyperroll.
